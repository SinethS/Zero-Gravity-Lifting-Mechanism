/*
exmple usage:

1. init the motor with the number of microsteps: motor stepper(200); 200 microsteps this is set by 4 switches on the motor driver. and enable the motor with stepper.ENmotor();

2. its recomeneded to use getAngle() to get the turned angle and throgh a necessary logic to set the speedControl() for most reliable and predicable results.
    2.1 in speedControl() the motor runs continously and the speed can be changed at any time. the direction is determined by the sign of the rpm. 
    2.2 use stopMotor() to stop the motor and reset the counter and PWM. this will also detach the interrupts and reset all the variables that keep track of the motor state.
    2.3 getAngle() has a maximum(depends on microstep) if many rotations are passing it needs to handleed accordigly this feature might be added in future in to this class.
    2.4 resetAngle() will reset the counter but not attach or detach the interrupts. this is useful if you want to reset the angle without stopping the motor.

3.its recomended to use turnAngle() in a single shout manner
    3.1 turnAngle() will set the angle and attach the interrupts. this will make the motor turn the angle.
    3.2 the sign of the angle determines the direction of the motor.
    3.3 if this functions is called contiounsly the counters will be reset contimously and will turn indefinitely with given rpms.
